## Background

The goal of this project was to build a flexible and modern online timer for puzzles. While many timers like this exist, none of them have a fluid user interface along with cloud synchronization of timers.

## Product

Pulze was built to be an online timer that is simplistic to use as well as being feature rich. It provides a 3D representation of the puzzled state as well as cloud synchronization of the times through a live database. The user interface was intentionally designed to be very flexible, with all elements being able to change in size and position.
